        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>High school student with strong computing abilities and writing skills and a shown interest in computer science and artificial intelligence. Recently, I have completed an online course on CSS and AI workshop. I am well-versed in many social media platforms as well as current events. I have extensive experience editing videos, producing high-quality photographs, and making thumbnails. I recently boosted my website-creation abilities by watching videos online. Recently, in school, my friend and I organized a Django (Python) workshop for 11th and 12th graders. Throughout my school years, I was voted and awarded a certificate for being the greatest problem solver in the class.</p>
